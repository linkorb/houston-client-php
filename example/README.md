Use these examples to test Houston functionality

## Setup environment variables

These examples assume the following three environment variables are set:

* HOUSTON_USERNAME
* HOUSTON_PASSWORD
* HOUSTON_URL

HOUSTON_URL should be full api endpoint with version

For example:
```
export HOUSTON_USERNAME="joe"
export HOUSTON_PASSWORD="secret"
export HOUSTON_URL="http://localhost:8080/api/v1"
```

Now run the examples like this:
```
php ./example/hosts.php
```
